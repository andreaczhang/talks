# Abstract

Public health surveillance: an open source approach



Join us for a discussion on how open source tools can enable automated, reproducible and scalable public health surveillance.



Situational awareness is key to fast response during a public health emergency, such as COVID-19 pandemic. However, making disease surveillance reports that cover different geographical units for various metrics and data registries is both resource intensive and time consuming. Open source tools such as R packages, GitHub and Airflow can make this process automatic, reproducible and scalable. 

Every day during the pandemic, Sykdomspulsen team at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI/NIPH) fetched data from more than 15 data sources, cleaned, censored datasets and carried out a wide range of statistical analyses. Over 1000 situational reports containing automated graphs and tables were produced before breakfast time. In this talk, Chi Zhang (link: https://andreaczhang.github.io) will talk about how they used and developed open source softwares to make public health surveillance and reporting more efficient, and discuss the benefits and concerns of making these data public.
