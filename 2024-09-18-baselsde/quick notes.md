# Outline

what is EHR / RWD

this is a researcher and analyst's perspective, on how we hope things are. not all hopes are lost; and on the power of open source software

#### why should companies (audience) care

- Information on **how drugs are actually used** 
- hospital is a goldmine for interesting data for AI!
- (how better EHR saves money for companies; how open source software such as R saves money)
- for drug developers and researchers, you want your data to be good 



Relevance and current trends, flatiron, mimic 4 and more

#### problems (elaborate with ab data)

EHR RWD are not research level data, not RCT - for clinical trial you have well established standards; EHR hasn't



I'm not going to talk about the common data issues - missing, messy, etc. instead I focus on the reason for these problems that occur

- **badly designed system prompts**?
- how **human** interact and register data



Show examples from imd-soft, metavision (our system), using the examples of **antibiotic stewardship**

#### solutions

Tool to identify the issues? my solution - ggehr 



Solutions in general

- **Better designed / configured system**. you still need well trained staff, but if your system is good then it helps reducing the fatigue, reducing error (this involves **vendor engagement** )
- use technology!
- you still care about privacy, but simplify the process = less bureaucracy



## Current system we use

iMD-soft

Metavision 

local configuration 



vendor engagement
