# Why use Quarto for your career?

It has been two years since Quarto became the most popular reproducible publication tool in data science and R community. However Quarto is so much more than just a publication tool. I started using it since late 2022, and it has helped me become more organized, productive and connected with people in the data science community.

In this talk I will not focus on the technical aspects on 'how' to use this tool. In the first part of the talk, I would like to report the latest news and trend seen in the useR conference and Posit conf, the two biggest global R events. In the second part, I will share my own experience in using Quarto for my career: from learning new skills, collaborating with co-workers, teaching university courses to networking and building a community (CAMIS collaboration). I hope this talk will provide you with some new ideas on how to use this fantastic technology to fulfill your goals.
