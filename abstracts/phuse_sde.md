### Abstract (150)

One step closer to better Electronic Health Records data

Real-World Data (RWD) like Electronic Health Records (EHR) is crucial for understanding drug usage and various treatments and generating Real-World Evidence (RWE). Risk prediction has been a major application where EHR is used, and there is now a shift towards causal inference, which requires data of even higher quality. Patients undergo treatments (drugs, procedures) at various times during their hospital stays, yet the data being recorded are messy and error-prone for various reasons. Analysts spend significant amount of time to sit together with clinicians to identify and understand abnormal records, and unfortunately this process is challenging to automate. 

This talk will use an example on antibiotics prescription and use at a Nordic hospital to illustrate how some EHR systems can improve for better clinical decision-making and better data for research. I will also introduce a pilot R package (ggehr) that facilitates visual exploration of EHR data, and how it can help reconstruct patient journeys and enable analysts to perform effective quality control.

- [flatiron linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/flatiron-health/), get some idea on how industry does things. 
- add the stuff from my workgroup, and other [RWE work group](https://advance.phuse.global/display/WEL/Real+World+Evidence) content 
  - [quality](https://advance.phuse.global/display/WEL/Quality+and+Reusability+of+Real+World+Data)
  - [estimands](https://advance.phuse.global/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=102858868)
  - [Archive](https://phuse.global/Communications/PHUSE_Archive/1), filter on 'real world', some content from 2019
  - should also add data quality in general, not just RWD
- OHDSI
- current research trend in prediction models and estimands, using EHR. focus especially on their choice of data, pay attention to how they describe the processing
- errors (this can be checked from AHUS paper literature list. do it after finishing the paper)
- drug dose monitoring over time, ICE, visual presentation of this kind of data should be interesting
