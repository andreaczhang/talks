# 1. Abstract

A personal website or blog is a great place to record, share and communicate your thoughts and learning process, however the whole procedure might seem complex to those without relevant experience. An R package developed by Yihui Xie, blogdown, makes it easy to build a website using R Markdown and Hugo. Andrea will talk about what is blogdown and why you should use it, and walk you through the basic steps to publish (for free!) your website using Netlify and rbind.io. 



About the speaker: 

Andrea (Chi Zhang) is doing her PhD at Department of Biostatistics, University of Oslo, working on Electronic Health Record data. She is interested in time series data related to health, and is eager to learn new tricks in R and share what she has learnt in her newly built website using blogdown. Outside work she is an active supporter of non profit organisations.

# 2. Details of each section

## Motivation part 

writing is important - help yourself, help others 

just a way to **oranise** your rmd files - either blogdown, or bookdown (more serious). don't necessarily webpage for the sake of webpage (book). 

academic **resume** (hence the academic theme)



## technical part 

*use a mindnode to link all these together !including the site structure!*

### R Markdown 

in short: rmd is an authoring format for data science. it has a whole ecosystem, 2016 bookdown, 2017 blogdown, 2018 pagedown (articles, business card, resume, html posters, letters, books with crc publisher) 

Book: R Markdown: the definitive guide http://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown

most important feature of rmd might be the **reproducibility** https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/r-markdown-the-bigger-picture! (75% - 90% of preclinical results are irreproduceable) We should create maps (like Columbus to the new world who brought a map, but not proof of the existence of new world ), not proofs. 



yihui has strong belief in HTML: only requires a web browser, easy to embed media 



will markdown save us?
