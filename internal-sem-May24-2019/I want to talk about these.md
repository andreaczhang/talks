### Outline: (25 min)

1. EHR data and challenges (8min)  <span style = 'color:royalblue'>To read</span>
   - EHR data 
   - open data: MIMIC, eICU
   - Challenges 
2. feature learning and application in medicine (5min) <span style = 'color:royalblue'>To read</span>
   - Feature/ representation learning: aim, methods, importance, difference from statistics modelling  
   - application in medicine <span style = 'color:tomato'>(why the audience should care about it)</span>
   - application in EHR
3. detailed description of target dataset (1min)
4. 2 representation methods for **phenotyping** and classification
   - deep methods (3 min)
   - our methods (8 min)



#### Take home message: 

- EHR data is challenging 
- representation learning is important



## Topic 1: EHR data and the challenge (8 min)



### EHR data



### open EHR data



### challenges 

â€¦ so there are these challenges, what can we do? 

Natural solution:





## Topic 2: feature learning and application in medicine (5min)

### Feature/ representation learning

aim, methods, importance, difference from statistics modelling

key questitons to address: 

- what is it 
- what makes a good representation
- how to do it



What is an example of a representation?

- One-hot representaion 

- PCA: one of the earliest linear feature learning algorithm.  <span style = 'color:royalblue'>Important! try to relate it to why it is widely used, to use principle components in regression</span>

### in medicine (not only EHR)





### EHR feature learning

now go back to look at our data: what can we use? NLP is one, but that is not what we will focus on. 

<span style = 'color:coral'>maybe a primer on tensor decomposition? and its uses in ML? Probably a separate section.</span>

introduction of this field (maybe with the help of this thesis I have found)









## Topic 3: detailed description of target dataset (1min)

## Topic 4: 2 representation methods and applications in phenotyping and classification



### Deep methods (3 min)
