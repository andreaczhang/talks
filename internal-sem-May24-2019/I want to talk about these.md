# Topic 1: MIMIC data and the challenge





â€¦ so there are these challenges, what can we do? 

Natural solution:

# Topic 2: feature/representation learning 

key questitons to address: 

- what is it 
- what makes a good representation
- how to do it



What is an example of a representation?

- One-hot representaion 

- PCA: one of the earliest linear feature learning algorithm.  <span style = 'color:royalblue'>Important! try to relate it to why it is widely used, to use principle components in regression</span>

## EHR feature learning

now go back to look at our data: what can we use? NLP is one, but that is not what we will focus on. 

<span style = 'color:coral'>maybe a primer on tensor decomposition? and its uses in ML? Probably a separate section.</span>

introduction of this field (maybe with the help of this thesis I have found)









# Topic 3: our method

- federated / collaborative / privacy preserving learning 

- Interpretability / causality
