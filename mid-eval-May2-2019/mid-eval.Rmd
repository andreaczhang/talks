## Paper 1 

Interveneable predictions of hospital acquired infection via a hierarchical lasso procedure using Electronic Health Records

### Motivation:

- a framework based on an interpretable model to predict an outcome, tradeoff between interpretabilitty and predictivity


- Outcome: HAI on a certain day in the future 
  - patients with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, etc
  
- Data type: time series predictors and response  
  - Lab tests: positive results, high white blood cell count, â€¦ 
  - Patient Characteristics: BMI, fever, ...
  - Procedures and medication: antibiotics, vasopressor drugs, ...
  - Staff: specialist nurses, working overtime, ...

### 2 steps approach
<br>

#### step 1: variable selection

select important time series covariates via hierarchical lasso penalty

$$min_{\beta} \sum_{t =1}^T || y^{(t)}  - \sum_{j = 1}^{p}  \sum_{l = 0}^{L} \beta_j^{(l)}  x_j^{(t-l)} ||_2^2 + \lambda \sum_{j = 1}^{p}  \sum_{l = 0}^{L}|| \beta_j^{(l)} ||_1$$

The fitted model prediction from the hierarchical variable selection is 

$$\hat{y}^{(t)} = \sum_{j = 1}^{p}  \sum_{l = 0}^{L} \hat{\beta}_j^{(l)}  x_j^{(t-l)}$$

---


#### step 2: prediction improvement

refit on residuals and historical lags of the response to improve prediction

Denote the residuals as $r^{(t)} = y^{(t)} - \hat{y}^{(t)}$

$$\tilde{y}^{(t)} =  \sum_{k = 1}^{K} \hat{\phi}^{(k)}  y^{(t-k)} + \sum_{j = 1}^{p}  \sum_{l = 0}^{L} \hat{\beta}_j^{(l)}  x_j^{(t-l)}$$
<br>
### Intervention

Change the value of certain variables at time $t$.

# Paper 2

Feature learning on heterogeneous temporal EHR data 

### Background
Data: MIMIC-III Critical Care Database (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III)


Challenges of EHR data

- heterogeneity: multiple sources; unstructured text/numeric measurements
- unequal length
- unevenly sampled 

Representatiton learning via 

- SAX: symbolic aggregate approximation
- Dynamic time warping: time series similarity
- Tensor decomposition: extract patient latent feature for classification task

# Plan for future works 

#### Paper 2 (priority)
- finish implementing our method on small cohort

- compare with other method (i.e. LSTM Autoencoder by Suresh2018 paper)

<br>
#### Paper 1



#### Paper 3

(some of my interests: )
- open dataset: eICU (50 centers)
- continue feature learning, patient phenotyping and tensor 
- privacy preserving ML for EHR data
- software development from paper 2
